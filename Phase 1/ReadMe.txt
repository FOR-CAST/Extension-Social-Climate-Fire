1. Move files in DLLs folder to "C:\Program Files\LANDIS-II\v6\bin\extensions" 
   -- You may have to rename the ones currently in there that they are replacing. I suggest appending "-backup" to the filename. 

2. navigate to \Scrapple\extension-scrapple\Phase 1\examples in your command prompt window

3. run the command "Batch"


I put 1 round of the output maps in \Scrapple\extension-scrapple\Phase 1\examples\fire. Each time you run it they will be overwritten.
